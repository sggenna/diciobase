A simple web platform that brings together multiple Brazilian Portuguese dictionaries in one place. Think of it as your one-stop shop for exploring different dictionary structures and finding comprehensive word information.

## What is this?

DicioBase is an academic project that combines several Brazilian dictionary sources into a single, searchable database. Instead of jumping between different dictionaries, you can explore how different sources define and structure the same words.

*Note: We're using placeholder data here since the real dictionary content is currently being used for academic research before being released.*

## Tech Stack
