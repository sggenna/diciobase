A collaborative research platform that brings together multiple dictionaries and linguistic databases in one unified interface. Part of an international partnership between Brazilian and French universities to advance multilingual lexicographic research.

## About the Project
DicioBase is an inter-institutional research project between UFMS,UFBA, UEL, UFRPE, in partnership with UniversitÃ© Sorbonne Paris Nord.
Our goal is simple: create an advanced multi-dictionary system that makes it easy to access and use different lexicographic sources. Instead of jumping between multiple websites and apps to consult different dictionaries, users can access a wide variety of linguistic resources from one place.
The platform is designed to connect various dictionaries and linguistic databases through a Web API, enabling seamless consultation across different languages and sources. We're also developing a protocol that allows different dictionary microstructures to communicate with each other.

*Note: We're using placeholder data here since the real dictionary content is currently being used for academic research before being released.*

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend:**
- Firebase Functions (Node.js)
- Express.js 
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase

**Tools & Deployment:**
- Firebase Hosting
## Features
- Clean, responsive design that works on any device
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Real-time search across all dictionary sources
- Text-to-speech for pronunciation help
  

## Academic Purpose

This project helps researchers study how different Brazilian Portuguese dictionaries organize and present information. It's particularly useful for comparing dictionary microstructures and identifying patterns across sources.

*This repository contains the platform infrastructure. Dictionary content and research data are managed separately by the participating institutions.*
